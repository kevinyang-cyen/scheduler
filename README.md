The Interviewer Scheduler is a web-app built using react, which allows the user to view current schedule and book an interview by picking a timeslot during the week, entering their name, and picking an available interviewer. The user may also update the schedule by editing or canceling existing interviews. This app was built to practice utilizing react, apis, axios, webpack, storybook, jest, and cypress.
